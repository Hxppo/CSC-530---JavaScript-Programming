            <h2>About Pokemon</h2>
            <p>
                Pokémon (Japanese: ポケモン Hepburn: Pokemon, Japanese: [pokemoɴ]; English: /ˈpoʊkɪˌmɒn, -ki-,
                -keɪ-/)[1][2][3] is a media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a Japanese consortium between
                Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.[4] The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but
                Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.[5] The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[6]
                and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch
                and train to battle each other for sport.
            </p>

                The franchise began as a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak
                and published by Nintendo. It now spans video games, trading card games, animated television shows and
                movies, comic books, and toys. Pokémon is the second best-selling video game franchise, behind only
                Nintendo's Mario franchise,[7] and the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The franchise is
                also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series.
            </P>
            <P>
                Cumulative sales of the video games (including home console games, such as Hey You, Pikachu! for the
                Nintendo 64) have reached more than 300 million copies.[8] In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which
                had managed the non-game related licensing of Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the
                Pokémon representation agreement. The Pokémon Company International (formerly Pokémon USA Inc.), a
                subsidiary of Japan's Pokémon Co., oversees all Pokémon licensing outside Asia.[9] As of March 2017, the
                Pokémon franchise has grossed revenues of ¥6.0 trillion worldwide[8] (equivalent to US$55.15 billion).

                The franchise celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006.[10] 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of the
                release of the original games, with the company celebrating by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50,
                issuing re-releases of Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow, and completely redesigning the way the newest
                games are played.[11][12] The mobile augmented reality game Pokémon Go was released in July 2016.[13]
                The first seventh-generation games Pokémon Sun and Moon were released worldwide on November 18,
                2016.[14] A live-action film adaptation based on Great Detective Pikachu began production in 2017.[15]
                The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All".[16][17]
